# Reference check and scaffold decisions

Checked: 2026-11-05. Deliverable: SKILL initial scaffold, not a runnable product.

## Shared references

- Installed `igapyon-miku-soft-developer` and its matching layer workflow.
- Installed `igapyon-repo-conventions` repository rules.
- Shared-source checkout HEAD: `493afba15c19ed7e3fc0c6868b4133cb2d929453`.
- Installed files are pinned below by digest; the checkout HEAD is context,
  not proof that the installed copies share the exact source revision.

- `igapyon-miku-soft-developer/SKILL.md`: `158fb40c08d427aa79d9e4589b7bf8077914d5b5acada94c5dfde1adb9cda0e0`
- `igapyon-miku-soft-developer/references/10-node-app-workflow.md`: `316ca2100ae04245645057bec484c696aac99952bd16a858d6dc300a3023fe2c`
- `igapyon-miku-soft-developer/references/40-agent-skills-workflow.md`: `cc65def976fea0e5d66f8b318aedafb217c42b4b17148484c990ed873a177cab`

## Sister examples inspected before scaffolding

| Local checkout | Inspected HEAD | Adopted shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/Users/igapyon/Documents/git/miku-indexgen` | `daf1e2b07f41e63a7e641ce18a6cdebfd3ec75d9` | small Node CLI, product-owned contracts, source/runtime separation |
| `/Users/igapyon/Documents/git/miku-indexgen-skills` | `cc6578a2aea71aea71955398231e249a96561e29` | installed `igapyon-` identity, skill-local runtime/lib, build bundle commands |
| `/Users/igapyon/Documents/git/miku-grep-skills` | `1adf7b735d8d50321ac65fc9e99d1377282d46a5` | thin CLI-backed skill, explicit product workflow, compact references |

These references already exist beside the target checkouts; no extra copies
were placed under workplace. No same-layer reference exists under the initially
empty target workplace. Sister source trees and older compatibility baselines
were not copied. Node-only scope follows the user: no Java companion/backend.

The main app stays JavaScript ESM rather than adopting the sister's TypeScript
toolchain. Its initial source/build/test entrypoints are deferred to the planned
tasks, so no empty test run is presented as product validation. The skill uses
the shared starter's packaging skeleton, which rejects missing declared runtime.
The initial upstream filename is a receipt target, not verified runtime identity.

## Baseline verification

The [official Node.js schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/Release/blob/main/schedule.json)
was checked: the project floor remains 22; newest LTS at the check date is 26.
Plan Node 22/24/26 verification and Node 26 release builds. Local environment:
Node v26.12.1, npm 11.20.0, Git 2.54.0. Lower Node lines have not been executed.

Workflow preparation uses the current official
[checkout v7](https://github.com/actions/checkout/releases/tag/v7.0.1),
[setup-node v7](https://github.com/actions/setup-node/releases/tag/v7.1.0), and
[action-gh-release v3](https://github.com/softprops/action-gh-release/releases/tag/v3.0.3)
lines. Hosted workflows have not been run.

The operational `10-node-app-workflow.md` uses `release: published`; the basic
main-app design has a conflicting tag-push example. Follow the workflow-specific
execution contract, keep this discrepancy recorded, and do not silently mix triggers.
Product path ordering retains the explicitly documented UTF-8 byte contract in
the product design; the shared UTF-16 preference is not silently substituted.

## Verification record

Initial scaffold checks are historical and are recorded separately in
[development.md](development.md). Current local checks are recorded there as
well: Node 22.23.4 and 26.12.1 pass all 13 tests, the isolated bundle runs
version/help/analyze, and macOS ZIP generation passes `unzip -t`. The CI matrix
now covers Node 22/24/26 on Ubuntu/macOS/Windows, but hosted runs have not yet
executed. Node 24 and non-macOS results remain unverified locally.
